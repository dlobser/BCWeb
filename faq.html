                    <p>Brain Candy is a VR app for Meta Quest that uses strobing lights, fractal visuals, binaural beats, and haptic feedback to create altered-state experiences. It's designed as an accessible alternative to expensive therapeutic strobe devices like the Lucia No.03 ($35k), Roxiva ($5k), and NeuroVizr ($600).</p>

                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p>The visuals exist in the same universe as screensaver art, but the key difference is the strobing. The patterns are there to hold your attention, but the rhythmic strobing is doing the work — using frequencies shown to create measurable changes in how the thalamus and visual cortex communicate (thalamocortical hyperconnectivity). It's a science-inspired art experience, not just pretty pictures.</p>

                    Do I keep my eyes open or closed?
                    <span class="arrow">▼</span>
                </div>
                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p>Brain Candy is designed for <strong>open eyes</strong>. Most traditional strobe lamps and goggles are made for closed eyes, where your eyelids diffuse the light and your brain generates the patterns. VR displays aren't bright enough to do much through closed eyelids. That said, some users with "thin eyelids" report cool closed-eye visuals too — especially after letting their eyes adjust in darkness first.</p>

                <div class="faq-question">
                    What about the patterns — are they real hallucinations or just graphics?
                    <span class="arrow">▼</span>
                </div>
                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p>Both. Some scenes use pure strobing where any patterns you see are generated by your own brain (the same Klüver form constants you'd see with expensive strobe lights, though less intense). Other scenes combine strobing with artistic visuals informed by the catalogued work of Klüver and Purkinĕ, who documented their own subjective flicker-light experiences centuries ago. The interesting thing is that these hallucinated patterns are highly mathematical and can be closely approximated using shader code.</p>

                    Is the audio synchronized to the visuals?

                </div>
                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p>It varies by scene. Some tightly synchronize visuals, audio, and haptics. Some are loosely coupled. Some are intentionally asynchronous. Each scene is built from scratch using a patch-bay style setup. The binaural beats tend to use something between true binaural (tones isolated to each ear) and isochronic (same source), with tones separated in stereo but not 100%.</p>

                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p>There is depth. All the scenes are built from layers of infinitely long tunnels and cones. The stereoscopic 3D is what really differentiates the VR experience from a flat screen.</p>

                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p>Brain Candy is a science-inspired art app, not a clinical device. The techniques it uses — frequency entrainment, fractal fluency, binaural beats — are based on peer-reviewed research. Any rhythmic visual stimulation at brainwave frequencies will show up on an EEG. Research at MIT is exploring strobing for Alzheimer's treatment. A study is in the works comparing real strobing with Brain Candy's simulated strobing.</p>
                    <p>That said, individual response is highly variable, and the leap from "we see theta waves on an EEG" to specific therapeutic claims is often overstated across the industry. Brain Candy doesn't make therapeutic claims.</p>

                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p>The scenes use a variety of rhythms across different sensory channels. Visual rhythms tend toward alpha range, while audio and haptics lean more delta or theta — but they also transition and oscillate, always changing. Randomizing parameters changes all of these details. Subtly changing frequencies create more interest and more intense visual hallucinations than steady-state rhythms. All the flicker light devices we're aware of craft their experiences with transitions rather than fixed frequencies.</p>

                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p>It's in the same general neighborhood as breathwork, float tanks, and light-based practices — but more subtle than classic psychedelics. Think of it as the anti-sensory-deprivation tank: sensory activation rather than sensory restriction. Unlike psychedelics, you can stop at any time, sessions are 20 minutes on average, and there's no 5-hour commitment you can't turn off. Brain Candy is for substance-free journeys.</p>

                    <p>At least one user reported an intense lucid dream after a short pre-bed session. Our dream research collaborator Dr. Deirdre Barrett (Harvard) notes that lucid dream triggers are highly individual, and proven methods take consistent work. One theory: Brain Candy's rhythmic stimulation may alter sleep architecture similarly to how "dream herbs" like Blue Lotus work — by making the sleeping brain slightly more awake. It's anecdotal for now, but we're paying attention.</p>
